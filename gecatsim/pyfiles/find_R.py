# Aim
#   This code can be used to find a rotation matrix R such that
#
#     R*x1=y1
#     R*x2=y2
#
#   assuming that:
#     1) x1, y1, x2, y2 are all unit vectors.
#     2) the angle between x1 and x2 is the same as the angle between y1 and y2
#
#   The code normalizes all vectors so that condition 1 is satisfied
#   If condition 2 is violated, we solve the orthogonal Procrustes problem
#   to make sure that R*x1 and R*x2 are as close as possible to y1 and y2 respectively.
