# xcist_kVp<kVp>_tar<targe angle>_bin1.dat
## How to generate a customized spectrum
1. use `XCISTspectrum.m` to generate spectrum at a user specified kVp/angle/energybin size. Note we will have a `.mat` file that is not readable to XCIST
2. modify the spectrum filename in `convert.py` and run it to obtain a spectrum file ending in `.dat` that can be read by XCIST

Note that the generated spectrum here is in unit of photons/mA/mm^2/s at 1m, i.e., we should specify the following in `cfg` file:\
`protocol.spectrumUnit_mm=1` \
`protocol.spectrumUnit_mA=1`

The spectrum generated is already filtered by tube window.

# tungsten_tar<targe angle>_<kVp>_filt.dat
They were generated by Xspectand filtered by tube window, and the unit is photons/mA/cm^2/s at 1m.
The settings should be:
`protocol.spectrumUnit_mm=0` \
`protocol.spectrumUnit_mA=1`
